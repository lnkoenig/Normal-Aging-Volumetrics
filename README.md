# Normal-Aging-Volumetrics
This project analyzes age-related atrophy in a cohort screened for preclinical AD. It is described in detail in a paper currently under review (will link to the paper when it is accepted).

The folders data-raw and data-clean referenced are not uploaded due to HIPAA protections.
The folder shiny_app contains the code and data used to create a shiny app that allows you to explore the data in more detail in the manuscript. View it at https://lnkoenig.shinyapps.io/NormalAgingVolumetrics_ShinyApp/ .

The cohort used is already described in the published paper Koenig et. al 2020: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102248.
